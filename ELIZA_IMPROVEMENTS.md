### Complete Code Files for New Features/Fixes

#### 1. Security Enhancements

**Remove Hardcoded Sensitive Information**

- **Before:**
  ```javascript
  // Example of hardcoded private key in truffle-config.js
  const privateKey = "0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE";
  ```

- **After:**
  ```javascript
  // Use environment variables for sensitive information
  const privateKey = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;
  ```

**Implementation Instructions:**
- Store sensitive information in environment variables or secure vaults.
- Update the deployment scripts to load these variables securely.

**Role-Based Access Control**

- **Example Implementation:**

  ```solidity
  // Role-based access control using OpenZeppelin
  pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

  import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";

  contract Governance is AccessControl {
      bytes32 public constant ADMIN_ROLE = keccak256("ADMIN_ROLE");
      bytes32 public constant MEMBER_ROLE = keccak256("MEMBER_ROLE");

      constructor() {
          _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
          _setupRole(ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
      }

      function addMember(address account) public onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE) {
          grantRole(MEMBER_ROLE, account);
      }

      function removeMember(address account) public onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE) {
          revokeRole(MEMBER_ROLE, account);
      }
  }
  ```

**Implementation Instructions:**
- Integrate this contract into the existing governance system.
- Ensure that only authorized roles can perform sensitive operations.

#### 2. DAO Governance Improvements

**Dynamic Governance Model**

- **Example Implementation:**

  ```solidity
  // Dynamic governance model with proposal voting
  pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

  contract DynamicGovernance {
      struct Proposal {
          string description;
          uint256 voteCount;
          bool executed;
      }

      Proposal[] public proposals;

      function createProposal(string memory description) public {
          proposals.push(Proposal({
              description: description,
              voteCount: 0,
              executed: false
          }));
      }

      function vote(uint256 proposalIndex) public {
          Proposal storage proposal = proposals[proposalIndex];
          require(!proposal.executed, "Proposal already executed");
          proposal.voteCount += 1;
      }

      function executeProposal(uint256 proposalIndex) public {
          Proposal storage proposal = proposals[proposalIndex];
          require(!proposal.executed, "Proposal already executed");
          require(proposal.voteCount > 0, "Not enough votes");
          proposal.executed = true;
          // Execute proposal logic here
      }
  }
  ```

**Implementation Instructions:**
- Deploy the contract and integrate it with the DAO frontend.
- Ensure community members can create and vote on proposals.

#### 3. Bug Fixes

**CI Pipeline Compatibility Fixes**

- **Before:**
  ```yaml
  # Example CI configuration with npm
  jobs:
    build:
      steps:
        - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
          with:
            node-version: '14'
        - run: npm install
  ```

- **After:**
  ```yaml
  # Updated CI configuration with pnpm
  jobs:
    build:
      steps:
        - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
          with:
            node-version: '20'
        - run: pnpm install
  ```

**Implementation Instructions:**
- Update the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file with the new configuration.

## Context-Specific Enhancements

Certainly! Below are code snippets addressing the specified requirements for the XMRT ecosystem and DAO. These snippets are designed to be integrated into a larger smart contract system and assume familiarity with Solidity and Ethereum-based development.

### 1. Smart Contract Security Improvements

To enhance security, we can implement a reentrancy guard to prevent reentrancy attacks:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ReentrancyGuard {
    bool private locked;

    modifier noReentrancy() {
        require(!locked, "ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call");
        locked = true;
        _;
        locked = false;
    }

    function safeWithdraw(uint256 amount) external noReentrancy {
        require(amount <= address(this).balance, "Insufficient balance");
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }
}
```

### 2. DAO Voting Mechanism Enhancements

Implement a quadratic voting mechanism to enhance fairness:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract QuadraticVotingDAO {
    struct Proposal {
        uint256 id;
        string description;
        uint256 voteCount;
        mapping(address => uint256) votes;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Proposal) public proposals;
    uint256 public proposalCount;

    function createProposal(string memory description) external {
        proposalCount++;
        proposals[proposalCount] = Proposal(proposalCount, description, 0);
    }

    function vote(uint256 proposalId, uint256 voteWeight) external {
        Proposal storage proposal = proposals[proposalId];
        uint256 quadraticVote = sqrt(voteWeight);
        proposal.votes[msg.sender] += quadraticVote;
        proposal.voteCount += quadraticVote;
    }

    function sqrt(uint256 x) internal pure returns (uint256 y) {
        uint256 z = (x + 1) / 2;
        y = x;
        while (z < y) {
            y = z;
            z = (x / z + z) / 2;
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Token Economics Optimizations

Implement a deflationary token mechanism with a burn feature:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract DeflationaryToken is ERC20 {
    uint256 public burnRate = 2; // 2% burn rate

    constructor() ERC20("DeflationaryToken", "DFT") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1000000 * 10 ** decimals());
    }

    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
        uint256 burnAmount = (amount * burnRate) / 100;
        uint256 sendAmount = amount - burnAmount;
        _burn(msg.sender, burnAmount);
        return super.transfer(recipient, sendAmount);
    }
}
```

### 4. Governance Process Improvements

Introduce a time-lock mechanism for proposal execution:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TimelockGovernance {
    struct Proposal {
        uint256 id;
        string description;
        uint256 voteCount;
        uint256 executionTime;
        bool executed;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Proposal) public proposals;
    uint256 public proposalCount;
    uint256 public constant MIN_DELAY = 1 days;

    function createProposal(string memory description) external {
        proposalCount++;
        proposals[proposalCount] = Proposal(proposalCount, description, 0, block.timestamp + MIN_DELAY, false);
    }

    function executeProposal(uint256 proposalId) external {
        Proposal storage proposal = proposals[proposalId];
        require(block.timestamp >= proposal.executionTime, "Timelock: too early to execute");
        require(!proposal.executed, "Proposal already executed");
        proposal.executed = true;
        // Execute proposal actions here
    }
}
```

### 5. Community Engagement Features

Implement a reward system for community participation:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract CommunityRewards {
    mapping(address => uint256) public rewards;

    event RewardClaimed(address indexed user, uint256 amount);

    function participateInEvent() external {
        // Logic for participation
        rewards[msg.sender] += 10; // Reward 10 tokens for participation
    }

    function claimReward() external {
        uint256 reward = rewards[msg.sender];
        require(reward > 0, "No rewards available");
        rewards[msg.sender] = 0;
        // Transfer reward tokens to the user
        // Assume transfer function is implemented
        emit RewardClaimed(msg.sender, reward);
    }
}
```

These snippets provide a foundation for enhancing security, voting, token economics, governance, and community engagement within the XMRT ecosystem. They should be integrated and tested within the broader context of your smart contract system.
